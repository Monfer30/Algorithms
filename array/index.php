//$scores = [0, 6, 4, 8, 7, 2, 1];

//To show the contents of an array, you use the var_dump() function.
//var_dump($scores);

//Or you can use the print_r() function
//print_r($scores);

//Itâ€™s more convenient to define a function that prints out an array like this:

function print_array($data)
{
    echo '<pre>';
    print_r($data);
    echo '</pre>';
}

$data = [5, 6, 8, 4, 7, 3, 9];

//Accessing array elements

$score = [6, 4, 3, 1, 5, 0];

echo $score[4];

//Adding an element to the array
$score[] = 6;
//But doing this, you have to calculate the new index manually. It is not practical
