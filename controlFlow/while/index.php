// WHILE

//The while statement executes a code block as long as an expression is true
//First, PHP evaluates the expression. If the result is true, PHP executes the statement
//Then, PHP re-evaluates the expression again. If itâ€™s still true, PHP executes the statement again. However, if the expression is false, the loop ends.

//The PHP do while statement allows you to execute a code block repeatedly based on a Boolean expression.
